Testing HTTP requests by using RESTAssured and JUnit
===

About
---
Using RESTAssured, I created JUnit tests to test 4 standard HTTP requests (Get, Put, Post, Delete).<br />
I did these tests on a project called "Microservice".<br />

Further instructions can be found there.


Note
---
Comment the @Ignore annotation if you want to use that particular test.<br />
I left it there because it helped me to test the test cases.
